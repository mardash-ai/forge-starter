# CLAUDE.md

This is a **Forge Builder workspace** — a project where you create and iterate on **one app**
through the **Forge** platform, not by writing files and running build tools directly.

**Every repo is a single app, and it lives at `./app`.** (The control plane runs in
single-app mode, `FORGE_APP_LAYOUT=single`.)

## The one rule

**Do all app lifecycle work through `./forge` (or `./new-app`). Never run `docker`, `npm`,
`next`, or `node` directly, and never `cat`/read the app's source to check its state.**

Forge runs everything in Docker, records each action as a Resource, and returns compact JSON.
Going around it loses reproducibility and wastes tokens.

## Fastest path: one command

To scaffold and fully validate the app end-to-end:

```bash
./new-app <kebab-name> [--with-postgres] [--with-redis] [--dev]
```

`new-app` runs the whole runbook (init → provision → install → build → test → lint), applies
the step gate after each step, auto-diagnoses failures with `forge explain`, and prints a
done summary. The app scaffolds into `./app`.

## Adding or evolving a feature

Use the **`add-a-feature` skill** (`.claude/skills/add-a-feature/SKILL.md`) — it's the source
of truth for the spec-driven, design-first workflow:

1. The human gives a short feature spec (Goal + acceptance criteria) → you save it at
   `specs/<feature-slug>/FEATURE.md`. If they didn't write one, infer it, and only ask about
   choices that are hard to reverse (e.g. *must this data persist across restarts?*).
2. **Design first for any UI** — produce `specs/<feature-slug>/DESIGN.md` via the
   **`frontend-design` skill** (and often an interactive mockup) before writing components.
3. Implement under `./app` (logic in `app/lib/`, pages in `app/app/`, tests in `app/tests/`).
4. Validate with `./forge lint/build/test` and self-heal via `./forge explain` until green.
5. Verify the behavior end-to-end (drive the running app; check persistence; screenshot UI).

## Iterating with the granular capabilities

The **`provision-app` skill** (`.claude/skills/provision-app/SKILL.md`) is the authoritative
runbook for the Forge mechanics:

```bash
./forge init app --name <name>            # scaffold into ./app (one app per repo)
./forge provision|install|build|test|lint --app <name>
./forge inspect app|routes|scripts|docker|events --app <name>
./forge explain --resource <id>           # diagnose a failure (don't read logs)
./forge plan --app <name> --goal "…"      # frame a feature Goal as a plan
```

- Branch on the JSON `.status` field, not the exit code (`build`/`test`/`lint` exit 0 even on failure).
- On `"failed"`, run `./forge explain --resource <id>` and fix only the files it names (under `./app/`).
- `--summary` for human-facing output; `--raw` only if explicitly asked.

## Layout

- `app/` — **the app** (this is the product; commit it). Next.js App Router lives at `app/app/`,
  logic at `app/lib/`, tests at `app/tests/`.
- `specs/` — feature specs. `specs/ADD_A_FEATURE.md` (how-to) + `specs/<feature-slug>/{FEATURE,DESIGN}.md`.
- `.forge/` — Forge's Resource/Event/log store (local, gitignored).
- `.claude/skills/` — `add-a-feature`, `provision-app`, `frontend-design`.
- `./forge`, `./new-app`, `compose.yaml`, `Makefile` — the launcher. Leave these alone.

Forge is consumed as a black-box platform (CLI/API only). There is no Forge source in this
repo to edit.
